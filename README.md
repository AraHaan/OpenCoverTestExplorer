# OpenCoverTestExplorer

A Test Explorer extension that analizes the OpenCover xml coverage reports
and marks in Visual Studio 2017 what lines are covered, partially covered, or not covered by unit tests.

This tool is designed for open source software to provide the Visual Studio 2017 Enterprice version code coverage check
for open source software like [StyleCop Analyzers](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers/).
